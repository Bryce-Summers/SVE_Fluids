#SVE_Fluids

Written by Bryce Summers. 

This is the starting project in my Simple Visual Experiments series, where I will try to make a series of short projects to keep my mental muscles in shape. It should also be useful to people who want to see self contained lines of code that accomplish specific tasks.

In this case, this repository will implement a fluid simulator based on the work of Jos Stam. He has a wonderful book entitled "The Art of Fluid Simulation" and also a paper on simple fluids online [here](http://www.intpowertechcorp.com/GDC03.pdf)
